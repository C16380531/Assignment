# Assignment
CA1

Instructions for use: Click on right pedal to accelerate,click on left pedal to deaccelerate. If fuel empty click text box to refuel car. If temperature gauge high brake to cool engine.

How I coded my assignment: I started out by drawing the shapes of the car window and the outlines of each of the gauges. I then added classes for both the pedals and declared global variables to pass values into my gauges. I used a if mousePressed function to find when each pedal was pressed and alter the relevant gauges.

What am I most proud of: I think the design of my gauges looks very appealing, also the line travelling down the road dependant on the speed of the car.
